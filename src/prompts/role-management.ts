  return `# Assigning Roles in Hats Protocol

I'll help you assign a role to ${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : 'the target address'} on ${networkName}.

## Step 1: Identify Available Roles

${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' 
  ? `Since you provided hat ID ${hatId}, let's verify this role first:

\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId}"
}
\`\`\`

This will show us:
- Role name and description
- Current supply vs max supply
- Admin permissions required
- Eligibility requirements` 
  : `First, let's find available roles in your organization:

${treeId !== '[TREE_ID]' 
  ? `\`\`\`
Use tool: get-tree-structure
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "treeId": "${treeId}",
  "format": "json",
  "maxDepth": 10
}
\`\`\`

This will show all roles in tree ${treeId} with their current assignments.`
  : `\`\`\`
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADMIN_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": false
}
\`\`\`

This shows roles you can manage based on your current permissions.`}`}

## Step 2: Check Eligibility and Permissions

${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' 
  ? `Let's verify the target address eligibility:

\`\`\`
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress}"
}
\`\`\`

This tells us if ${targetAddress} is already wearing this hat.`
  : 'Make sure you have the target address ready for the assignment.'}

## Step 3: Execute the Assignment

Once we've confirmed the role and eligibility:

\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-mint-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[TARGET_ADDRESS]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Step 4: Verify Assignment

After the transaction is complete, verify the assignment:

\`\`\`
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[TARGET_ADDRESS]'}",
  "includeInactive": false
}
\`\`\`

## Assignment Checklist

- [ ] Role is available (not at max supply)
- [ ] Target address meets eligibility requirements
- [ ] You have admin permissions for this role
- [ ] Target address is not already wearing this hat
- [ ] Gas fees are available for the transaction
- [ ] Assignment follows organizational policies

## Common Issues and Solutions

### üö´ "Not eligible" Error
- Check eligibility module requirements
- Verify the target address meets criteria
- Ensure any prerequisite roles are held

### üö´ "Max supply reached" Error  
- Role is at capacity
- Need to increase maxSupply (requires admin)
- Or reassign from inactive wearer

### üö´ "Not authorized" Error
- You don't have admin permissions
- Request assignment from appropriate admin
- Check your own role permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gas Estimation Issues
- Network congestion - try later
- Insufficient funds in wallet
- Consider batching multiple operations

function generateTransferRoleContent(networkName: string, targetAddress: string, hatId: string): string {
  return `# Transferring Roles in Hats Protocol

I'll help you transfer a role ${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? `(${hatId})` : ''} on ${networkName}.

## Step 1: Verify Current Role Assignment

First, let's confirm the current state of the role:

\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Identify Current and New Wearers

${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' 
  ? `New wearer: ${targetAddress}

We need to identify the current wearer. If you know their address, great! If not, the hat details above will show current wearers.`
  : 'We need both the current wearer address and the new wearer address.'}

## Step 3: Execute the Transfer

\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-transfer-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "from": "[CURRENT_WEARER_ADDRESS]",
  "to": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[NEW_WEARER_ADDRESS]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Transfer Authorization Methods

### Option 1: Admin-Initiated Transfer
- Requires admin privileges for the role
- Can transfer without current wearer consent
- Most common for organizational changes

### Option 2: Self-Transfer (if enabled)
- Current wearer initiates the transfer
- Requires role to allow self-transfers
- Used for voluntary role transitions

### Option 3: Burn and Mint
If direct transfer isn't possible:

1. **Burn current assignment**:
\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-burn-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "[CURRENT_WEARER_ADDRESS]"
}
\`\`\`

2. **Mint to new wearer**:
\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-mint-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[NEW_WEARER_ADDRESS]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Step 4: Verify Transfer

Confirm the transfer was successful:

\`\`\`
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[NEW_WEARER_ADDRESS]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Transfer Best Practices

### üîÑ Smooth Transitions
- **Communication**: Notify both parties in advance
- **Documentation**: Record the reason for transfer
- **Timing**: Consider operational impact
- **Access**: Update any external systems/permissions

### üîê Security Considerations  
- **Verification**: Confirm new wearer's identity
- **Eligibility**: Ensure new wearer meets requirements
- **Backup**: Have rollback plan if needed
- **Monitoring**: Watch for any issues post-transfer

### üìã Organizational Process
- **Approval**: Follow internal approval processes
- **Training**: Ensure new wearer understands role
- **Handover**: Facilitate knowledge transfer
- **Systems**: Update org charts and documentation

## Common Transfer Scenarios

### Leadership Changes
- CEO transitions, board member changes
- Often requires top-hat admin approval

### Team Restructuring
- Role reassignments within departments
- Department head approval typically sufficient

### Emergency Situations
- Immediate role removal needed
- May use burn then mint approach

### Voluntary Transitions
- Employee role changes, promotions
- Usually straightforward mint process

function generateRemoveRoleContent(networkName: string, targetAddress: string, hatId: string): string {
  return `# Removing Roles in Hats Protocol

I'll help you remove a role ${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? `(${hatId})` : ''} from ${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : 'the target address'} on ${networkName}.

## Step 1: Verify Current Assignment

Let's confirm the current role assignment:

${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' 
  ? `\`\`\`
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress}"
}
\`\`\`

This confirms ${targetAddress} is currently wearing the role.`
  : `\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}"
}
\`\`\`

This shows all current wearers of the role.`}

## Step 2: Execute Role Removal

\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-burn-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[TARGET_ADDRESS]'}"
}
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Verify Removal

Confirm the role was successfully removed:

\`\`\`
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "${targetAddress !== '[TARGET_ADDRESS]' ? targetAddress : '[TARGET_ADDRESS]'}",
  "includeInactive": true
}
\`\`\`

The role should now appear as inactive/burned in the results.

function generateModifyRoleContent(networkName: string, hatId: string): string {
  return `# Modifying Roles in Hats Protocol

I'll help you modify role ${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : 'properties'} on ${networkName}.

## Current Role Analysis

First, let's examine the current role configuration:

\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${hatId !== '[HAT_ID]' ? hatId : '[ROLE_HAT_ID]'}"
}
\`\`\`

This shows:
- Current role name/description
- Maximum supply settings
- Eligibility modules
- Toggle modules
- Mutability status
- Current wearers

## Role Modification Options

### üìù Metadata Changes (If Mutable)
- **Role Name**: Update title/description
- **Image URI**: Change role icon/logo
- **Details**: Modify role description

### üë• Supply Management
- **Increase Max Supply**: Allow more wearers
- **Decrease Max Supply**: Reduce capacity (if current < new max)

### üîß Module Updates (If Mutable)
- **Eligibility Module**: Change who can wear the hat
- **Toggle Module**: Modify activation/deactivation logic

## Modification Procedures

### üîÑ Creating Updated Role
Since Hats Protocol roles are immutable by default, modification often requires creating a new version:

\`\`\`
Use tool: prepare-create-hat
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "admin": "[ADMIN_HAT_ID]",
  "details": "Updated Role Name and Description",
  "maxSupply": "[NEW_MAX_SUPPLY]",
  "eligibility": "[NEW_ELIGIBILITY_MODULE]",
  "toggle": "[NEW_TOGGLE_MODULE]",
  "mutable": true,
  "imageURI": "[NEW_IMAGE_URI]"
}
\`\`\`

### üîÑ Migration Process
1. **Create New Role**: With updated parameters
2. **Transfer Wearers**: Move from old to new role
3. **Update Systems**: Point to new role ID
4. **Deprecate Old Role**: Burn old assignments

### üîÑ If Role is Mutable
Direct updates may be possible (check role details for mutability):
- Use admin privileges to update metadata
- Modify supply through admin functions
- Update modules if allowed

## Common Modification Scenarios

### üìà Team Growth
**Issue**: Need more team members than max supply allows

**Solution**:
\`\`\`
1. Create expanded role:
{
  "maxSupply": "[HIGHER_NUMBER]"
  // other parameters same
}

2. Migrate existing wearers
3. Deprecate original role
\`\`\`

### üéØ Role Refinement
**Issue**: Role description needs updating

**Solution**:
\`\`\`
{
  "details": "Refined Role Description with Better Clarity",
  // keep other parameters
}
\`\`\`

### üîê Permission Updates
**Issue**: Different eligibility requirements needed

**Solution**:
\`\`\`
{
  "eligibility": "[NEW_ELIGIBILITY_MODULE_ADDRESS]",
  // maintain other parameters
}
\`\`\`

### üîß System Integration Changes
**Issue**: Need different toggle behavior

**Solution**:
\`\`\`
{
  "toggle": "[NEW_TOGGLE_MODULE_ADDRESS]",
  // preserve other settings
}
\`\`\`

## Step-by-Step Migration

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Analyze Current State**: Document all current wearers
2. **Plan Changes**: Define exactly what needs modification
3. **Create New Role**: Deploy with updated parameters
4. **Test New Role**: Verify it works as expected

### Phase 2: Migration
1. **Notify Stakeholders**: Communicate change timeline
2. **Begin Transfers**: Move wearers to new role
3. **Update Documentation**: Change org charts/systems
4. **Monitor Progress**: Ensure smooth transition

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. **Verify All Transfers**: Confirm complete migration
2. **Burn Old Roles**: Remove old assignments
3. **Update References**: Change all system pointers
4. **Document Changes**: Record modification history
