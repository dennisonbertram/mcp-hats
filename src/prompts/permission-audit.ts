I'll help you conduct a comprehensive audit of your entire organization's permissions on ${networkName}.

## Phase 1: Organization Structure Analysis

### Step 1.1: Map Complete Hierarchy
\`\`\`
Use tool: get-tree-structure
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "treeId": "${target !== '[TARGET]' ? target : '[ORGANIZATION_TREE_ID]'}",
  "format": "json",
  "maxDepth": 15
}
\`\`\`

This provides:
- Complete organizational hierarchy
- All role relationships and dependencies
- Admin chains and delegation paths
- Role supply and capacity information

### Step 1.2: Identify All Role Holders
For each role found in the hierarchy, we'll query current assignments:

\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[EACH_ROLE_HAT_ID]"
}
\`\`\`

## Phase 2: Permission Risk Assessment

### üîç Critical Permission Analysis

#### Top Hat Holders (Highest Risk)
- **Control Level**: Complete organizational control
- **Risk Factor**: Maximum - can modify all roles
- **Monitoring**: Should be limited to 1-2 trusted addresses
- **Backup**: Ensure secure storage and recovery plans

#### Admin Role Concentrations
- **Multi-role Admins**: Addresses with admin over multiple roles
- **Wide Authority**: Roles with many child roles
- **Cross-department**: Admins spanning multiple areas

#### High-privilege Individual Analysis
Identify addresses with extensive permissions across the organization.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Permission Vulnerabilities

#### Excessive Concentration
- Single points of failure
- Too many permissions in one address
- Lack of separation of duties

#### Inactive Admins
- Admin addresses not actively used
- Potentially compromised accounts
- Outdated organizational structure

#### Missing Controls
- Roles without proper admin oversight
- Unlimited max supply roles
- Missing eligibility requirements

## Phase 3: Detailed Audit Execution

### Step 3.1: Role-by-Role Analysis
For comprehensive coverage, analyze each role:

\`\`\`
# For each role in the organization:
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ROLE_ID]"
}

# Check current wearers:
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ROLE_ID]",
  "wearer": "[EACH_WEARER_ADDRESS]"
}
\`\`\`

### Step 3.2: Individual Permission Maps
For key personnel, create complete permission profiles:

\`\`\`
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[KEY_PERSON_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": ${includeInactive}
}
\`\`\`

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Define Your Audit Scope
Please specify:
- **Scope Type**: Organization, Individual, Role, or Tree
- **Target**: Address, Hat ID, or Tree ID to audit
- **Depth**: How comprehensive you want the analysis
- **Timeline**: When results are needed

### Step 2: Initial Discovery
Let's start with basic discovery to understand your context:

\`\`\`
# If you know your tree ID:
Use tool: get-tree-structure
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "treeId": "${target !== '[TARGET]' ? target : '[YOUR_TREE_ID]'}",
  "format": "ascii-tree",
  "maxDepth": 5
}

# If you want to see your own roles:
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": false
}

# If you have a specific role to examine:
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "${target !== '[TARGET]' ? target : '[HAT_ID]'}"
}
\`\`\`
