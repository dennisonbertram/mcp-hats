function generateTransactionFailedContent(networkName: string, errorDetails: string, transactionHash: string): string {
  return `# Transaction Failure Troubleshooting

I'll help you diagnose and resolve the transaction failure on ${networkName}.

## Step 1: Transaction Analysis

${transactionHash ? `### Transaction Hash Analysis
Let's examine the failed transaction: ${transactionHash}

**Manual Investigation**:
- Check transaction on block explorer (Etherscan for Ethereum, etc.)
- Look for revert reason in transaction receipt
- Examine gas usage vs gas limit
- Check transaction status and confirmations` : 
`### Transaction Hash Needed
To properly diagnose the issue, please provide:
- **Transaction Hash**: The hash of the failed transaction
- **Wallet Address**: Address that submitted the transaction
- **Approximate Time**: When the transaction was submitted`}

${errorDetails ? `### Error Message Analysis
Error: "${errorDetails}"

${analyzeErrorMessage(errorDetails)}` : 
`### Error Details Needed
Please provide any error messages you received:
- Wallet error messages
- Block explorer error details
- Console errors (if using web interface)
- RPC error responses`}

## Step 2: Common Transaction Failure Causes

### üö´ Insufficient Permissions
**Symptoms**: "Unauthorized", "Not admin", "Access denied"
**Cause**: Your address lacks required permissions for the operation

**Diagnosis**:
\`\`\`
# Check your current roles
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": false
}

# Check specific role details
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[RELEVANT_HAT_ID]"
}
\`\`\`

**Solutions**:
1. **Get Admin Rights**: Request appropriate admin role from organization
2. **Use Admin Account**: Switch to account with proper permissions
3. **Verify Role Chain**: Ensure you have admin rights for the specific role

### ‚õΩ Gas-Related Issues
**Symptoms**: "Out of gas", "Gas limit exceeded", "Insufficient funds"

#### Gas Limit Too Low
**Cause**: Transaction needs more gas than provided
**Solution**: Increase gas limit by 20-50%

#### Insufficient Balance
**Cause**: Not enough ETH/native tokens for gas
**Solution**: Add funds to wallet

#### Gas Price Too Low
**Cause**: Network congestion, transaction not prioritized
**Solution**: Increase gas price or wait for lower congestion

### üìä Supply and Capacity Issues
**Symptoms**: "Max supply exceeded", "Hat not available"
**Cause**: Role is at maximum capacity

**Diagnosis**:
\`\`\`
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ROLE_HAT_ID]"
}
\`\`\`

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase Max Supply**: If role is mutable, admin can increase capacity
2. **Wait for Vacancy**: Someone must leave role first
3. **Burn Inactive**: Remove inactive role holders

### üîí Eligibility Module Issues
**Symptoms**: "Not eligible", "Eligibility check failed"
**Cause**: Address doesn't meet eligibility requirements

**Common Eligibility Requirements**:
- Must hold specific tokens
- Must already wear prerequisite roles
- Must meet custom criteria defined by module

**Diagnosis Steps**:
1. **Check Module Address**: Get eligibility module from role details
2. **Review Requirements**: Understand what criteria must be met
3. **Verify Compliance**: Ensure target address meets all requirements

### üîÑ State Conflicts
**Symptoms**: "Already wearing hat", "Invalid state transition"

#### Already Wearing Role
**Cause**: Address already has the role you're trying to assign
**Solution**: Check current assignments first, or burn then re-mint if intentional

#### Role Dependencies
**Cause**: Trying to create child role before parent exists
**Solution**: Create roles in proper hierarchical order

## Step 3: Network-Specific Issues

### üåê ${networkName} Specific Problems
${networkName === 'ethereum' ? `
**Ethereum Mainnet Issues**:
- **High Gas Costs**: Prices can spike during congestion
- **Slow Confirmation**: Can take 5+ minutes during busy periods
- **MEV Issues**: Complex transactions may be front-run
- **Network Congestion**: High demand can cause delays

**Solutions**:
- Monitor gas tracker websites
- Use EIP-1559 transactions with priority fees
- Consider timing transactions during low activity
- Use flashbots or similar for MEV protection
` : networkName === 'polygon' ? `
**Polygon Network Issues**:
- **MATIC Balance**: Need MATIC for gas fees, not ETH
- **RPC Issues**: Some RPC endpoints may be unreliable
- **Bridge Delays**: Deposits from Ethereum can take time
- **Reorg Risk**: Slightly higher reorganization risk

**Solutions**:
- Ensure wallet has MATIC balance
- Try alternative RPC endpoints
- Wait for sufficient confirmations
- Monitor for chain reorganizations
` : `
**${networkName} Network Issues**:
- Verify network is supported by your wallet
- Check for network-specific gas token requirements
- Ensure RPC endpoint is working properly
- Confirm Hats Protocol is deployed on this network
`}

## Step 4: Diagnostic Commands

### üîç Comprehensive Diagnosis
Run these commands to gather information:

\`\`\`
# 1. Check your account status
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": false
}

# 2. Check target role status (if applicable)
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[TARGET_HAT_ID]"
}

# 3. Check organizational structure
Use tool: get-tree-structure
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "treeId": "[ORGANIZATION_TREE_ID]",
  "format": "json",
  "maxDepth": 5
}

# 4. Verify specific role assignment (if applicable)
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[RELEVANT_HAT_ID]",
  "wearer": "[TARGET_ADDRESS]"
}
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Resolution Strategies

### üîÑ Immediate Actions
1. **Check Transaction Status**: Confirm it actually failed vs. still pending
2. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure all addresses and IDs are correct
3. **Check Permissions**: Confirm you have required admin rights
4. **Review Balance**: Ensure sufficient funds for gas

### üîß Common Fixes

#### Permission Issues
\`\`\`
# If you need admin rights, request from current admin:
# 1. Identify current admin of the role
# 2. Request assignment to admin role
# 3. Retry original operation with admin permissions
\`\`\`

#### Gas Issues
\`\`\`
# Retry with higher gas:
# 1. Increase gas limit by 50%
# 2. Use higher gas price if network is congested
# 3. Ensure wallet has sufficient balance
\`\`\`

#### Supply Issues
\`\`\`
# If role is at capacity:
# 1. Check if any current wearers are inactive
# 2. Burn inactive assignments to free capacity
# 3. Or increase maxSupply if role is mutable
\`\`\`

### üìä Systematic Approach
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Use diagnostic commands to pinpoint issue
2. **Address Underlying Problem**: Fix permissions, gas, or parameters
3. **Retry Operation**: Execute corrected transaction
4. **Verify Success**: Confirm intended changes occurred
5. **Document Resolution**: Record solution for future reference

## Step 6: Prevention Strategies

### üõ°Ô∏è Pre-Transaction Checks
Always verify before executing:
- [ ] Correct network selected in wallet
- [ ] Sufficient balance for gas fees
- [ ] All addresses are valid and correct
- [ ] You have required permissions
- [ ] Role has available capacity (if applicable)
- [ ] Transaction parameters are reasonable

### üìã Testing Methodology
- **Start Small**: Test with simple operations first
- **Use Testnets**: Try complex operations on test networks
- **Simulate First**: Use eth_call to simulate before execution
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch first transaction before batching

### üîÑ Recovery Planning
- **Document Everything**: Keep records of all operations
- **Have Rollback Plans**: Know how to undo changes if needed
- **Test Recovery**: Practice fixing common issues
- **Stay Updated**: Keep track of protocol changes

## Step 7: Advanced Debugging

### üî¨ Deep Transaction Analysis
If basic troubleshooting doesn't work:

#### Contract Event Analysis
- Check for relevant events in transaction logs
- Look for partial execution in complex transactions
- Verify all expected state changes occurred

#### State Verification
\`\`\`
# Before and after state comparison:
# 1. Record state before transaction
# 2. Execute transaction
# 3. Compare resulting state
# 4. Identify what didn't change as expected
\`\`\`

#### Module Interaction Issues
- Custom eligibility modules may have bugs
- Toggle modules might not be working correctly
- Inter-contract calls could be failing

### üîß Developer Tools
For technical users:

Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]",
  "includeInactive": false
}
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Common Permission Problems

### üö´ Insufficient Admin Rights

#### "Not Authorized" Errors
**Symptoms**: Can't create, mint, burn, or transfer roles
**Root Cause**: Your address lacks admin permissions for the target role

**Diagnosis Process**:
\`\`\`
# 1. Check the role you're trying to manage
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[TARGET_ROLE_HAT_ID]"
}

# 2. Check if you wear the admin role
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ADMIN_HAT_ID_FROM_STEP_1]",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]"
}
\`\`\`

**Solutions**:
1. **Get Admin Role**: Request assignment to appropriate admin role
2. **Use Admin Account**: Switch to account that has admin permissions
3. **Check Role Hierarchy**: Verify you're admin of the correct parent role

### üîê Role Assignment Permissions

#### Can't Assign Roles to Others
**Symptoms**: "Unauthorized mint", "Not eligible to mint"
**Common Causes**:
- Not admin of the role being assigned
- Role is at maximum supply
- Target address doesn't meet eligibility requirements
- Role is currently inactive (toggle module)

**Step-by-Step Resolution**:
\`\`\`
# 1. Verify role capacity and status
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ROLE_TO_ASSIGN]"
}

# 2. Check your admin permissions
Use tool: query-hats-by-wearer

  "includeInactive": false
}

# 3. Verify target eligibility (if relevant)
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ROLE_TO_ASSIGN]",
  "wearer": "[TARGET_ADDRESS]"
}
\`\`\`

### üè¢ Organization-Level Permissions

#### Can't Create New Roles
**Symptoms**: Unable to create child roles in organization
**Investigation**:
- Do you hold an admin role that can create children?
- Is your admin role active and in good standing?
- Are you trying to create at the correct level in hierarchy?

**Verification**:
\`\`\`
# Check organizational structure and your position
Use tool: get-tree-structure
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "treeId": "[ORGANIZATION_TREE_ID]",
  "format": "json",
  "maxDepth": 10
}
\`\`\`

#### Top Hat Management Issues
**Symptoms**: Can't perform organization-wide operations
**Critical Checks**:
- Do you hold the top hat for this organization?
- Has the top hat been transferred or burned?
- Is there a permissions hierarchy issue?

## Step 3: Module-Specific Permission Issues

### üîß Eligibility Module Restrictions

#### Eligibility Requirements Not Met
**Symptoms**: "Not eligible", "Eligibility check failed"
**Understanding Eligibility**:
- Modules can require token balances, other roles, or custom criteria
- Requirements can change over time
- Module bugs can cause unexpected failures

**Diagnosis**:
\`\`\`
# Get role details to find eligibility module
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[RESTRICTED_ROLE_ID]"
}

# The eligibility field will show the module address
# You'll need to check what requirements that module enforces
\`\`\`

**Common Eligibility Types**:
- **Token-based**: Must hold minimum amount of specific ERC20
- **Role-based**: Must wear prerequisite hat(s)
- **Time-based**: Only eligible during certain time periods
- **Custom Logic**: Arbitrary conditions defined by module

### üîÑ Toggle Module Restrictions

#### Role Deactivated by Toggle
**Symptoms**: Role exists but appears inactive or unusable
**Understanding Toggles**:
- Toggle modules can activate/deactivate roles dynamically
- Can be controlled by admins, time, or other conditions
- Inactive roles can't be used even if assigned

**Resolution**:
1. **Identify Toggle Module**: Get address from role details
2. **Check State**: Determine if role is currently active
3. **Understand Control**: Who or what can toggle the role
4. **Request Activation**: Contact toggle controller if needed

## Step 4: Hierarchical Permission Analysis

### üå≥ Understanding Role Hierarchy
Hats Protocol uses nested permissions:
- **Top Hat**: Ultimate authority over entire organization
- **Admin Roles**: Can manage specific subordinate roles
- **Child Roles**: Inherit permissions from parent structure

### üìä Permission Inheritance
\`\`\`
Organization Tree Example:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Top Hat (0x00000001...)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CEO (0x00000001.0001...)          [Can manage all below]
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CTO (0x00000001.0001.0001...) [Can manage tech roles]
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CFO (0x00000001.0001.0002...) [Can manage finance roles]
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COO (0x00000001.0001.0003...) [Can manage ops roles]
\`\`\`

### üîç Tracing Permission Chains
To understand why you can't perform an action:

\`\`\`
# 1. Identify the target role's admin
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[TARGET_ROLE]"
}

# 2. Check if you wear that admin role
Use tool: check-hat-wearer
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ADMIN_ROLE_FROM_STEP_1]",
  "wearer": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]"
}

# 3. If not, check if you're admin of the admin role
Use tool: get-hat-details
Parameters:
{
  "networkName": "${networkName}",
  "hatId": "[ADMIN_ROLE_FROM_STEP_1]"
}

# Continue until you find your level in the hierarchy
\`\`\`

## Step 5: External System Permission Integration

### üîó Connected Systems Not Recognizing Roles
**Symptoms**: Have Hats role but can't access connected applications
**Common Issues**:
- Application not synced with blockchain
- Wrong network configuration
- Authentication middleware issues
- Role mapping problems

**Troubleshooting**:
1. **Verify Blockchain Connection**: Ensure app connects to correct network
2. **Check Authentication**: Verify wallet connection and signature
3. **Clear Caches**: Refresh any cached permission data
4. **Contact Support**: Report integration issues to application team

### üì° API and Middleware Issues
**Integration Problems**:
- Subgraph data delays
- RPC endpoint issues  
- Authentication token expiration
- Permission caching problems

**Solutions**:
- Try different RPC endpoints
- Wait for subgraph synchronization
- Refresh authentication tokens
- Clear application caches

## Step 6: Resolution Strategies

### üéØ Immediate Actions

#### Permission Escalation
If you need higher permissions:
1. **Identify Required Role**: Determine what admin level you need
2. **Contact Admin**: Request assignment from appropriate admin

function generateGasEstimationContent(networkName: string, errorDetails: string): string {
  return `# Gas Estimation Issues Troubleshooting

I'll help you resolve gas estimation and transaction cost issues on ${networkName}.

## Step 1: Gas Issue Diagnosis

${errorDetails ? `### Current Gas Problem
Issue: "${errorDetails}"

${analyzeGasError(errorDetails)}` : 
`### Gas Issue Details Needed
Please specify the gas problem you're experiencing:
- Are transactions failing due to gas issues?
- Are gas estimates unusually high or low?
- Are you getting "out of gas" errors?
- Are you concerned about transaction costs?`}

### üîç Gas Fundamentals on ${networkName}
${networkName === 'ethereum' ? `
**Ethereum Mainnet Gas**:
- **Unit**: Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei)
- **Typical Range**: 20-200 Gwei (varies with congestion)
- **Transaction Cost**: Gas Used √ó Gas Price
- **EIP-1559**: Base fee + priority fee structure
` : networkName === 'polygon' ? `
**Polygon Gas**:
- **Unit**: MATIC
- **Typical Range**: 30-500 Gwei MATIC
- **Low Cost**: Usually $0.01-0.50 per transaction
- **Fast Confirmation**: 2-5 seconds typical
` : networkName === 'arbitrum' ? `
**Arbitrum Gas**:
- **Unit**: ETH (but much cheaper than mainnet)
- **Cost Reduction**: ~90% cheaper than Ethereum mainnet
- **L1 Component**: Some cost for L1 data posting
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjusts based on usage
` : `
**${networkName} Gas**:
- Check current gas prices for this network
- Understand native token requirements
- Monitor network congestion patterns
- Verify gas estimation accuracy
`}

## Step 2: Common Gas Issues

### ‚õΩ Gas Estimation Problems

#### Estimates Too Low
**Symptoms**: "Out of gas", "Gas limit exceeded"
**Causes**:
- Complex operations requiring more gas than estimated
- Network conditions changed between estimation and execution
- Smart contract state changes affecting gas usage
- Estimation tools using outdated or incorrect data

**Solutions**:
\`\`\`
# When preparing Hats transactions, use higher multipliers:
{
  "gasEstimateMultiplier": 1.5  // 50% buffer instead of default 20%
}

# For complex operations, consider even higher:
{
  "gasEstimateMultiplier": 2.0  // 100% buffer for safety
}
\`\`\`

#### Estimates Too High  
**Symptoms**: Extremely expensive transaction quotes
**Causes**:
- Network congestion causing price spikes
- Inefficient transaction construction
- Wrong network selected
- RPC endpoint issues

**Investigation**:
\`\`\`
# Check current network gas prices
# Compare with gas tracker websites
# Verify you're on the correct network
# Try different RPC endpoints
\`\`\`

### üí∞ Cost-Related Issues

#### Transaction Too Expensive
**Symptoms**: Gas costs exceed budget or expectations

**Cost Analysis for Hats Operations on ${networkName}**:
- **Top Hat Creation**: ${getGasCostEstimate(networkName, 'tophat')}
- **Role Creation**: ${getGasCostEstimate(networkName, 'create')}
- **Role Assignment**: ${getGasCostEstimate(networkName, 'mint')}  
- **Role Transfer**: ${getGasCostEstimate(networkName, 'transfer')}
- **Role Removal**: ${getGasCostEstimate(networkName, 'burn')}

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Timing**: Execute during low congestion periods
2. **Batching**: Combine multiple operations
3. **Network Choice**: Use L2 for lower costs
4. **Gas Price**: Use appropriate gas price settings

#### Insufficient Balance
**Symptoms**: "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Solutions**:
- Add more ${networkName === 'ethereum' ? 'ETH' : networkName === 'polygon' ? 'MATIC' : 'native tokens'} to wallet
- Check minimum balance requirements
- Consider transaction priority vs. cost

## Step 3: Network-Specific Gas Issues

### üåê ${networkName} Gas Characteristics
${networkName === 'ethereum' ? `
**Ethereum Mainnet Gas Issues**:
- **Extreme Volatility**: Prices can spike 10x during congestion
- **MEV Impact**: Complex operations may be front-run
- **Time Sensitivity**: Gas prices change rapidly
- **High Base Costs**: Even simple operations cost $5-50+

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Use gas trackers to time transactions
- Consider EIP-1559 priority fees
- Batch operations when possible
- Use flashbots for MEV protection
` : networkName === 'polygon' ? `
**Polygon Gas Considerations**:
- **MATIC Required**: Need MATIC for gas, not ETH
- **Price Stability**: More predictable than Ethereum
- **Occasional Spikes**: Can increase during high usage
- **Bridge Considerations**: Moving MATIC from Ethereum

**Common Issues**:
- Wrong token for gas (using ETH instead of MATIC)
- Underestimating during network stress
- RPC endpoint reliability issues
` : `
**${networkName} Gas Considerations**:
- Verify native token requirements
- Understand network fee structures
- Monitor for congestion patterns
- Check RPC endpoint reliability
`}

### üìä Gas Monitoring Tools
For ${networkName}:
${getGasMonitoringTools(networkName)}

## Step 4: Hats-Specific Gas Patterns

### üé≠ Operation Gas Usage
Different Hats operations have predictable gas patterns:

#### Simple Operations (Lower Gas)
\`\`\`
mint-hat:        ~40,000-60,000 gas
burn-hat:        ~30,000-50,000 gas
check-hat-wearer: ~25,000-35,000 gas (view function)
\`\`\`

#### Complex Operations (Higher Gas)
\`\`\`
mint-top-hat:    ~60,000-100,000 gas
create-hat:      ~80,000-150,000 gas
transfer-hat:    ~50,000-100,000 gas
\`\`\`

#### Variable Factors
Gas usage increases with:
- Longer role descriptions/details
- Complex eligibility modules
- Toggle module interactions
- First-time contract interactions
- Cold storage access

### üîß Gas Optimization for Hats

#### Parameter Optimization
\`\`\`
// Reduce gas with shorter descriptions
"details": "Dev Team" // vs "Development Team - Frontend and Backend Engineers"

// Use IPFS for longer content
"details": "Dev Team",
"imageURI": "ipfs://QmHash" // vs data URLs
\`\`\`

#### Batch Operations
\`\`\`
// Instead of 5 separate mint transactions:
// Use multicall or batch operations to reduce overhead
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Gas Failures

### üö´ "Out of Gas" Errors

#### Immediate Solutions
1. **Increase Gas Limit**: Add 20-50% to estimate
2. **Check Balance**: Ensure sufficient funds
3. **Retry Later**: Network congestion may decrease
4. **Split Operations**: Break complex transactions into smaller parts

#### Investigation Process
\`\`\`
# 1. Check if transaction was actually executed
# 2. Review transaction receipt for actual gas used
# 3. Compare with estimate to understand shortfall
# 4. Identify if issue is systematic or one-off
\`\`\`

### ‚ö° Transaction Stuck in Mempool

#### Symptoms
- Transaction pending for long time
- No confirmation after reasonable wait
- Gas price too low for current network conditions

#### Solutions
\`\`\`
# Option 1: Speed up transaction (increase gas price)
# Option 2: Cancel transaction (send 0 ETH to self with higher gas)
# Option 3: Wait for network conditions to improve
# Option 4: Replace with higher gas price version
\`\`\`

## Step 6: Gas Estimation Best Practices

### üéØ Estimation Strategies

#### Conservative Approach
\`\`\`
# Always use safety margins
{
  "gasEstimateMultiplier": 1.5,  // 50% buffer
  "fromAddress": "[YOUR_ADDRESS]"  // Accurate estimation context
}
\`\`\`

#### Dynamic Adjustment
\`\`\`
// Adjust based on network conditions
if (networkCongested) {
  gasMultiplier = 2.0;
} else {
  gasMultiplier = 1.2;
}
\`\`\`

### üìä Monitoring and Alerting
Set up monitoring for:
- Network gas price trends
- Your transaction success rates
- Cost per operation over time
- Failed transaction patterns

### üîÑ Adaptive Strategies
- **Peak Hours**: Higher gas prices but faster confirmation
- **Off Hours**: Lower costs but potentially slower confirmation
- **Emergency**: Willing to pay premium for immediate execution
- **Batch Processing**: Accumulate operations for efficiency

## Step 7: Advanced Gas Management

### üîß Custom Gas Strategies

#### Time-based Optimization
\`\`\`
// Schedule non-urgent transactions for low-gas periods
// Use gas price predictions to optimize timing
// Set up automated execution based on price thresholds
\`\`\`

#### Priority Management
\`\`\`
Critical Operations (High Gas):
- Emergency role assignments
- Security-related changes
- Time-sensitive organizational changes

Standard Operations (Medium Gas):
- Regular role assignments
- Routine organizational updates
- Planned structural changes

Batch Operations (Optimized Gas):
- Bulk role assignments
- Periodic maintenance
- Non-urgent updates
\`\`\`

### üìä Cost Tracking
Maintain records of:
- Gas costs per operation type
- Network condition impacts
- Optimization effectiveness
- Budget vs. actual spending

## Step 8: Emergency Gas Procedures

### üö® High Priority Transactions
When immediate execution is critical:

1. **Premium Gas**: Use high gas price for fast confirmation
2. **MEV Protection**: Use flashbots or similar for sensitive operations
3. **Multiple Attempts**: Prepare backup transactions with increasing gas
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for confirmation and adjust if needed

### üõ°Ô∏è Gas Budget Management
- Set spending limits for different operation types
- Monitor cumulative costs over time
- Plan for network congestion scenarios
- Have emergency gas reserves

### üìã Recovery Procedures
For stuck or failed transactions:
1. **Assess Situation**: Determine urgency and impact
2. **Choose Strategy**: Speed up, cancel, or wait
3. **Execute Fix**: Implement chosen solution
4. **Monitor Result**: Verify successful resolution
5. **Learn**: Document issue and prevention strategies
