# MCP Hats Protocol Server - Development Summary

## Project Overview
Comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Hats Protocol operations, providing tools for role management, permission checking, organizational structures, and transaction preparation on EVM chains.

## Development Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure ✅
- **Modern TypeScript Project**: ES2022 target with strict mode enabled
- **Multi-Chain Network Support**: 8 blockchain networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Gnosis, Sepolia, Base-Sepolia)
- **MCP Server Architecture**: Complete server setup with tool registration framework
- **Hats SDK Integration**: VIEM-based client wrapper with caching
- **Subgraph Client**: GraphQL integration with 10+ predefined queries
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all Hats Protocol entities
- **Configuration Management**: API key system with secure storage

### Phase 2: Read Tools Implementation ✅
- **check-hat-wearer**: Verify if an address wears a specific hat with good standing
- **get-hat-details**: Get comprehensive hat information including supply, modules, hierarchy
- **query-hats-by-wearer**: Find all hats worn by an address with tree grouping
- **get-tree-structure**: Visualize hat tree hierarchy in multiple formats (JSON, ASCII, flat)
- **44 passing tests** with comprehensive coverage
- **Dual data sources**: Subgraph queries with SDK fallback for reliability
- **Both hat ID formats**: Support for full hex and pretty notation

### Phase 3: Write Tools Implementation ✅
- **prepare-create-hat**: Create new hats in the hierarchy
- **prepare-mint-hat**: Assign hats to wearers (with batch support)
- **prepare-burn-hat**: Remove hats (supports both self-renounce and admin removal)
- **prepare-transfer-hat**: Transfer hats between addresses
- **66 passing tests** for write tools
- **Transaction Builder Utility**: Common patterns with gas estimation
- **DAO-Deployer Pattern**: External signing workflow for hardware wallets

```

### Key Features
1. **Multi-Network Support**: 8 blockchain networks with fallback RPC URLs
2. **Dual Tool Types**: 
   - Read tools for querying current state
   - Write tools for preparing transactions (external signing)
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: 110+ tests across both tool types
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript throughout with comprehensive interfaces
5. **Performance Optimization**: Client caching, connection pooling, efficient queries
6. **Security First**: No private keys, external signing only
7. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and graceful fallbacks
