# Hats Protocol MCP Write Tools Implementation

## Task Description
Implement 4 core write tools for the MCP Hats Protocol server that prepare transactions for external signing, following the DAO-Deployer pattern.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 write tools implemented and functional
- [ ] Transaction builder utility created for common patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with mock contracts
- [ ] Gas estimation accurate with safety buffer
- [ ] Pre-flight validations working correctly
- [ ] Server registration updated
- [ ] Integration with existing read tools verified
- [ ] Error handling clear and user-friendly

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Review existing codebase structure
- [ ] Research Hats Protocol contract interfaces
- [ ] Create transaction builder utility
- [ ] Set up test infrastructure

### Phase 2: Tool Implementation (TDD)
1. **prepare-create-hat**
   - [ ] Write failing tests
   - [ ] Implement transaction preparation
   - [ ] Add validation logic
   - [ ] Implement gas estimation
   - [ ] Test with mock contracts

2. **prepare-mint-hat**
   - [ ] Write failing tests  
   - [ ] Implement transaction preparation
   - [ ] Add eligibility checks
   - [ ] Support batch operations
   - [ ] Test with mock contracts

3. **prepare-burn-hat**
   - [ ] Write failing tests
   - [ ] Implement transaction preparation
   - [ ] Add authority validation
   - [ ] Handle dependencies
   - [ ] Test with mock contracts

4. **prepare-transfer-hat**
   - [ ] Write failing tests
   - [ ] Implement transaction preparation
   - [ ] Add transfer permission checks
   - [ ] Verify eligibility
   - [ ] Test with mock contracts

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Update server.ts registration
- [ ] Test with existing read tools
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Performance testing

### Phase 4: Documentation & Review
- [ ] Document transaction examples
- [ ] Get code review
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Final testing

## Technical Details

### Transaction Structure
```typescript
interface PreparedTransaction {
  to: Address;
  data: Hex;
  value: bigint;
  gas: bigint;
  gasPrice?: bigint;
  maxFeePerGas?: bigint;
  maxPriorityFeePerGas?: bigint;
  nonce?: number;
  chainId: number;
}
```

### Key Dependencies
- viem: Transaction encoding and gas estimation
- @mcp-hats/sdk: Contract interfaces
- ethers: Fallback utilities

## Progress Log

### 2024-08-25 19:24
- Set up git worktree at `/Users/dennisonbertram/Develop/ModelContextProtocol/.worktrees-mcp-hats/hats-write-tools`
- Created branch `feature/hats-write-tools`
- Copied foundation code from existing MCP server
- Created development plan

### 2024-08-25 20:25 - COMPLETED
- ✅ Researched Hats Protocol contract interfaces and ABIs
- ✅ Created transaction builder utility with all helper functions
- ✅ Implemented prepare-create-hat with full TDD (15 tests passing)
- ✅ Implemented prepare-mint-hat with batch support (17 tests passing)
- ✅ Implemented prepare-burn-hat with renounce/remove logic (16 tests passing)
- ✅ Implemented prepare-transfer-hat with validation (18 tests passing)
- ✅ Updated server.ts to register all write tools
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript issues for strict mode compliance
- ✅ All 66 write tool tests passing
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation summary

## Edge Cases to Consider
1. Parent hat doesn't exist
2. Hat supply limit reached
3. Wearer already has maximum hats
4. Admin permissions revoked mid-transaction
5. Gas price spike during preparation
6. Network congestion
7. Module eligibility changes

## Review Notes
- Pending initial review of plan and approach
